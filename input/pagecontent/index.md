### Scope

Specify **HL7 FHIR logical models** and **profiles** to be used within
the European project X-eHealth for supporting the **European EHR
eXchange Format.**

### The X-eHealth Project

#### Overview 

X-eHealth is a 24-month Cooperative and Support Action (CSA) project
starting in September 2020.

Its main objective is to promote a **faster and sustainable EU digital
transformation** and **develop the basis for a workable, interoperable,
secure cross border Electronic Health Record Exchange Format (EEHRxF).**
The project will build upon the already in place Patient Summary, and
develop the foundations for medical imaging, discharge letters,
laboratory results and rare diseases.

X-eHealth will also work for aligning efforts of ongoing initiatives
supporting the Digital Transformation of Health and Care (DTHC)
priorities at the European level and supporting implementers and
developers of EEHRxF in member states and across the world.

#### Objectives

1.  **To reach a common understanding** in the EU **on the** **efforts
    needed to adopt the commonly defined EEHRxF specifications** at
    different levels and within their nationaI EHR solutions

2.  **To** **define, specify and demonstrate the EEHRxF use cases**
    laboratory results, medical imaging and reports, hospital discharge
    reports and patient summary for those suffering from rare disease
    and/or comorbidities.

3.  To **elaborate the roadmap** for the above-mentioned use cases for
    future uptake on the eHDSI as well as for the additional usage
    within MS on national, regional or local level

4.  **To submit the outcomes and recommendations of X-eHealth**
    regarding EEHRxF deployment to the relevant bodies on policy,
    strategic and operational level (e.g. eHealth Network, National
    Competence Centres for eHealth, eHDSI operators) 7 951938 X-eHealth
    – Part B

5.  **To propose a governance framework** for the sustainable
    maintenance, evolution and distribution of standardisation and
    interoperability
