For example:\r\n1. no exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is correctly omitted.\r\n2. an exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is present.\r\nDerived models or implementable specifications shall maintain an equivalent conformance strength; but it is allowed to modify the conformance strength if the predicate condition permits.\r\nRecipient shall understand conditional elements, when required. For example, a conditional element that could be optional or not present could be omitted by a derived model and ignored by a recipient. Or, a condition for which a conditional element become required doesn’t apply to a jurisdiction, in that case a jurisdictional specification could omit that element and recipient could ignore it.\r\nDepending on the conditions, exception is or is not raised if the data are missing.\r\n\r\nO; Optional ; This data element can be omitted from a derived model, including from implementations.\r\nRecipient may ignore optional elements.\r\nIf it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list, a label concept, a complex data type) the presence of the included elements is determined by the presence of this element and the conformance rules of its sub-elements. For example, no exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is omitted.\r\nThe reason for specifying the optional data elements is to ensure that both sender and recipient use the appropriate semantic interpretation of these elements.\r\nNo exception is raised if the data are missing."
